		<div class="alert">What is this app about?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">The primary purpose of this app is to help people plan, manage and collaborate on gatherings easier and more efficiently.</div>
		<div class="alert">Can I use this app for other events like baby showers, birthdays and other events?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">While this app was originally intended for potlucks, you can use this app for events as you see fit.</div>

		<div class="alert">What are some of the key features about this app?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em"><ul><li>Create your own custom lists (e.g. Appetizers, Board games, Snacks, Movies, etc).</li><li>Easily RSVP with as little or many items you wish.</li><li>Easily track the total amount of guests attending, not coming and undecided.</li><li>An easy-to-use dashboard which provides the information you need fast</li><li>Easily notify groups of individuals or individual guests at a time.</li><li>Automated email reminders that remind guests to rsvp and that the event is coming.</li><li>Settings that allow you to turn notifications on/off and to customize when event reminders get sent out (Host only)</li><li>Maintain email distribution lists for common groups of people you invite</li><li>Easily promote guest to assist you (e.g. cohost) your events</li></ul></div>

		<div class="alert">Do I have to pay for this?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">As this is currently in alpha, this is free. In return I would like to get your honest feedback about what you like, what you don't like, what could be improved and any potential future features that would encourage you to continue using it.</div>

		<div class="alert">What should I do if I encounter a problem with the app or if there are defects?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Email me at cavenator@gmail.com and provide me a description of what the defect is and how to reproduce it (e.g. the steps that you took in order to encounter this defect).</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="overview_tag"></a>Quick Overview</div>
		<div class="alert">Options</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em"><ul><li><b>My Groups:</b>This is where you manage common groups of friends such as coworkers, college buddies, family, etc</li><li><b>Settings:</b>When you are hosting events, these settings adjust notifications and configure reminders. Settings for when you are a guest to a event will be coming shortly!</li></ul></div>

		<div class="alert">As a host</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em"><ul><li><b>Potluck statistics:</b>This is a dashboard which indicates the amount of people coming, # of items they are bringing versus the amount of items requested</li><li><b>My list:</b>This is where you manage your list. While lists may seem ambiguous, the intent is to keep it generic enough to include things like boardgames, chairs, silverware and many more (including potluck items)</li><li><b>Invite Guest:</b>This is the automated way of inviting guests (especially if you want to add multiple guests at a time). As implied, you provide a comma-delimited email string which sends invites out and adds them to the guest list (when they sign up/login, they get synced up with events and their name fields populate automatically on the guest list)</li><li><b>The guest list:</b> As this implies, you can manage your guests here. You do have the option of entering them in manually if they have no email but I would advise that you use <b>Invite Guest</b> if you want to add more than one at a time.</li><li>The other options filter the guest list by whos coming, whos not coming, etc</li></ul></div>

		<div class="alert">As a guest</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em"><ul><li><b>Available items:</b>Quick view of the items that the host is asking for.</li><li><b>Items others are bringing:</b>Quick view of what others are bringing. Helpful in getting an idea of what others are bringing so you know how to fill in gaps.</li></ul>Finally, the RSVP. This is pretty self explanatory except that when you declare you are coming, you can add items to your rsvp (with as little as none or as many as you can feasibly bring)</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="getting_started_tag"></a>Getting Started</div>
		<div class="alert">What do I need to do in order to start using this?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">First, create an account.</div>

		<div class="alert">What is the bare minimum that I need to provide in order to create an event?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">After you create an account, you should be able to create events pretty easily.  At a bare minimum, you just need to provide a name for the event, the start/end dates of the event, and when you need guests to rsvp by.</div>

		<div class="alert">How do I invite guests?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">As a host, you'll be able to invite guest using the <b>Invite guest</b> option when you are viewing the details of the event. You'll be able to invite guests via comma-delimited emails (e.g. email1, email2, email3). This is the preferred method of adding the guests to your event since the system will automatically take care of adding them rather than you manually providing that information via <b>The guest list</b>.</div>

		<div class="alert">Can I manually add guests without using the <b>Invite guest</b> option?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">I understand that certain guests may not have email and would rather call you instead of using the system. For this purpose, this app will allow you to rsvp on their behalf. You can do so by using the <b>The guest list</b> option (enter guest manually and rsvp for them).</div>

		<div class="alert">Any other advice for getting started?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">I would recommend creating your lists before inviting guests. While it is possible for your guests to rsvp without declaring what they are bringing, it might be good for them to get an idea of what is needed for the event.</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="lists_tag"></a>List FAQ</div>

		<div class="alert">What kind of lists can I create?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">You can pretty much create any type of list you wish: Appetizers, Snacks, Beer/Alcohol, Boardgames, Movies, Xbox games, etc. For example, create a list with Games as your category and enter each game on a separate field (you can dynamically add as many items as you wish for a particular category).</div>

		<div class="alert">Do you have any recommendations on effectively creating list?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">You can pretty much create any type of list you wish: Appetizers, Snacks, Beer/Alcohol, Boardgames, Movies, Xbox games, etc. However, it's best that you be as specific as possible with your categories so that your items will be easily categorized and specific. A category of Food and having 30+ items is not an easy way to provide lists for your guests AND does not provide you an easy way to see what guests are bringing. Therefore, having specific categories like Snacks, you can then differentiate items like Chips/Salsa, Pretzels, Peanuts, Bite-size candy. The next list could then be Appetizers with items such as Spring Rolls, Nachos, Taquitos, Buffalo Wings.</div>

		<div class="alert">What is this <b>Desired number of items</b> that I am seeing when I create my list?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">That is meant to represent the number of items you need for guest to contribute for the potluck. For example, you create a list of category Boardgames with a host quantity of 2 and provide 5 games as suggestions. This is primarily for you to keep track of whether or not your "quota" for that particular category has been met.</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="groups_tag"></a>My Groups FAQ</div>
		<div class="alert">What is this &quot;My Groups&quot; thing?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em"><b>My Groups</b> is analogous to an email distribution list.  This way, you can manage multiple email distributions and easily import groups into your event. This is helpful if you do plan multiple events with the same group of friends, coworkers, etc.</div>

		<div class="alert">So how do I make a group?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Ensure that when you create a group, you supply a name and a list of comma-delimited emails (e.g. email1, email2, email3) and so on. That is it.</div>

		<div class="alert">When I first create the list, there is a big textbox and when I want to edit it, the list is itemized.  Why is that?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">It's my understanding that when one first creates an email distribution group, one pretty much has a solid list of people in mind. Therefore, when modifications to the email distribution list are needed, it's usually adding/removing a couple of guests at a time. I found this much easier to manage lists that were already created rather than modifying in a large textbox.</div>

		<div class="alert">So how do I add emails to an existing group?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Click the button <b>Add more</b> button. Each new box <b>ONLY</b> should contain one email at a time if you want it to work properly.</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="cohost_tag"></a>Cohost FAQ</div>
		<div class="alert">What can a cohost do?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Since the event creator is the only one who can promote their guest to cohost, the cohost is a designated guest who can assist in managing the event details (such as inviting guests, managing lists for guests to choose from, etc). The only thing a cohost cannot do is promote other guests.</div>

		<div class="alert">How can I promote a guest to cohost?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">For a event you create, click on the <b>The Guest List</b>. You'll see a + next to the people you can promote. Once you click the +, they will be promoted. To demote them and make them an ordinary guest again, click the - instead.</div>

		<div class="alert">Why don't I see +/- next to some entries?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">You will only see +/- once your guest actually has an email address</div>

		<div class="alert">+/- is lame. Couldn't you use better images?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Thats in progress .... :)</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="messaging_tag"></a>Messaging FAQ</div>

		<div class="alert">When I send someone a message, how does that work?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">The message gets routed to their declared email account. Therefore, they will get the message as you send it.</div>

		<div class="alert">Why can I message some people and others I cannot?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Thats because the host added them to the system without specifying what their email address is. You are only allowed to message guests that have email addresses declared.</div>

		<div class="alert">i keep getting messages from letsgather.apartyapp@gmail.com.  what's this about?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">That is the automated emailer that sends messages to users and guests of this sytem. Until I switch over from using Gmail to a more scalable SMTP server like SendGrid, the name remains. therefore, please advise people to not label this as spam. When you send a message using this app, you'll see the subject where it belongs but the message will start with "a message from name" followed by the message contents.</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="rsvp_tag"></a>RSVP FAQ (Guest)</div>
		<div class="alert">I want to RSVP for an event I was invited to. How difficult is it?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">It should be pretty easy. Once you sign in, select the event you wish to rsvp to. Click "Modify RSVP" to enter your response.</div>

		<div class="alert">What is the bare minimum I need to RSVP?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">By default, your response is <b>Undecided</b>. You only need to change that answer. However, once you decide you are going, you will be presented another list of options. Those options include: <ul><li># of guests you are bringing (excluding you)</li><li>Any items you wish to bring</li></ul>You also have the option of providing a comment (or updating your comment to let the host know of any updates).</div>

		<div class="alert">Do I have to RSVP with an item?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">No. You may decide what to bring to the event later but inform the host you plan on coming.</div>

		<div class="alert">What if I want to bring more than one item (or if I am answering on behalf of a guest I am bringing)?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">If you are bringing someone to an event you are invited to (such as a friend and/or partner), you may add items to your rsvp and just provide a short comment saying that you and your guests are bringing those items. This app allows for multiple items to be umbrellaed under one RSVP response (e.g. You could be bringing a guest and each of you brings an item. Therefore, you can add another item to your rsvp (Just press the <b>Add more</b> button).</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="settings_tag"></a>Settings FAQ</div>
		<div class="alert">What kind of settings are available?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Right now, settings are only available for hosts (I got feedback from a particular host. Guest settings per event are coming soon). Those settings are as follows: <ul><li>Notify me when a guest rsvps yes</li><li>Notify me when a guest rsvps no</li><li>Notify me of all guest response changes (use tthis with discretion since you might get spammed depending on the fickleness of your guest)</li><li>Send out rsvp reminders X days before the rsvp deadline</li><li>Send out Event reminders X days before the start date</li></ul></div>

		<div class="alert">What is this future events setting all about?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">You can configure future settings that will apply to all future events you create (hence host). Therefore, if there are common settings you want applied to all events going forward, set it up appropriately. It still gives you the freedom to configure specific event settings if the need arises</div>

		<div class="alert">When are guest settings coming?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Hopefully very soon! The only setting that I can think of for the time being is <b>Notify me of any major event changes (applies to event times, description, location).</b> There will be more for when you have cohost settings and even more depending on what type of feedback I get.</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info"><a id="future_tag"></a>Future plans</div>
		<div class="alert">Do you anticipate delivering new features while this is in alpha?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Yes, I do. So far, the following features will be released sometime during beta-testing and you'll be notified: <ul><li>Guest settings for events they are invited to</li><li>More infrastructure changes</li><li>Find a UI/UX person to hopefully make it prettier (with colors and themes)</li></ul>If there are things that the majority of users are bringing to my attention, I'll prioritize it accordingly.</div>

		<div class="alert">What if I have an idea for some killer features?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Email me at cavenator@gmail.com and let me know. I would love to hear feedback about how you are enjoying my app, what you do not like about it and if you have any ideas on how to make it better.</div>

		<div class="alert">How fast can you get new features and fixes out?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">Depends on the complexity and how much time I have. Since I do work full-time and I am the only developer supporting this, my availability is not much. However, if you do encounter a defect that is a show-stopper and prevents you from managing your event, please raise it to my attention and I'll work on it as quickly as I can.</div>

		<div class="alert">How long will this alpha-phase last?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">I am only planning on having this live until mid-September (end of Summer). However, if you really do enjoy using it and want to continue to use it, please let me know. If there are enough users that want to continue to use this, I'll keep it going longer.</div>

		<div class="alert">Are you planning on making this into a mobile app?</div>
		<div style="display:block; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em">This app is not the best on a smartphone and I would recommend you using this on a desktop/labtop browser or a tablet browser. At the least, I want to make this a mobile-friendly site so I am going to work on that first. However, I would like to make this into a smartphone/tablet app once I get feedback after this alpha test and users make it <b>CLEAR</b> what functionality they love, what should be tossed and what is needed for continued use.</div>

		<div class="alert-success">So Bottom line:  <b>Feedback is important so please take some time and get back to me if this app is something you want to continue using in the future!</b></div>
